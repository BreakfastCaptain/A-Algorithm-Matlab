# README

Three files are included in the same folder to implement the A* algorithm, and running A_star.m loads the Map.mat and gets the paths as well as the visual map:

1. pointPrint.m ：After the A* algorithm is finished, the path is printed and the map is visualised
2. PointInfo.m ： A class named `PointInfo` is defined to store and manage the parameter information for each point in the A* algorithm 
3. A_star.m ：A* Algorithm implementation
